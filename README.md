## Features:

Graphical Representation: The application provides a graphical representation of mathematical curves and fractals, allowing users to explore and understand them visually.

User Interaction: Users can interact with the application by selecting different types of curves and fractals through buttons in the user interface.

Customization: The application allows users to customize the appearance of the curves by adjusting parameters such as scale, interval length, and step count.

Fractal Generation: In addition to mathematical curves, the application also generates fractals such as Mandelbrot set, Julia set, Sierpinski triangle, Fractal Tree, and Dragon Curve.

Color Selection: Users can choose colors for the background and the curves, providing flexibility in visualizing the curves according to their preferences.

## Technologies Used:

C++: The core programming language used for implementing the application logic.

Qt Framework: Qt framework is utilized for building the graphical user interface and handling user interactions.

Mathematical Algorithms: Various mathematical algorithms are employed for computing the points on curves and generating fractals.

## Installation and Running


1. Clone the repository:
``` git clone git@github.com:Anastasiia-Ni/MathCurves.git ```

2. Make sure Qt is installed on your system.
4. Open the project in Qt Creator.
5. Build and run the project.
   
or
   **Running on macOS:**
1. Clone the repository.
   
2. Double-click on the executable file `MathCurves.app` located in the project folder.
   
3. If prompted, confirm that you want to open the application from an unidentified developer (if applicable).
   
4. The application should launch, and you can begin using it to visualize mathematical curves and fractals.
   

## Usege:

Launch the Application: Execute the application executable to launch the "MathCurves" interface.

Select a Curve or Fractal: Click on the corresponding button to select a mathematical curve or fractal.

Adjust Parameters: Use the provided spin boxes to adjust parameters such as scale, interval length, and step count to customize the appearance of the curves.

Explore and Visualize: Explore different curves and fractals visually by interacting with the application. Experiment with parameter values to observe changes in the graphical representation.
